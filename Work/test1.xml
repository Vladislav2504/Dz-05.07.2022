        <line>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sum.</line>
        <line>Coral is far more red than her lips red.</line>
        <line>If snow be white, why then her lips red.</line>
        <line>if hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.</line>
        <line>I have seen roses damasked, red and white.</line>
        <line>But no such roses see I in her cheeks.</line>
        <line>And in some perfumes is there more delight.</line>
        <line>Than in the breath that from  my mistress reeks.</line>
        <line>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know.</line>
        <line>that music hath a far more pleasing sound.</line>
        <line>I grant I never saw a goddess go.</line>
        <line>my mistress when she walks, treads on the group.</line>
        <line>And yet, by Haven, I think my love as rare.</line>
        <line>As any she belied whit false compare.</line>
